PREFACE</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> issue of this second volume of
<i>Popular Ballads of the Olden Time</i> has been delayed chiefly by the
care given to the texts, in most instances the whole requiring to be
copied by hand.</p>

<p>I consider myself fortunate to be enabled, by the kind service of my
friend Mr. A.&nbsp;Francis Steuart, to print for the first time in a
collection of ballads the version of the <i>Grey Selchie of Shool
Skerry</i> given in the Appendix. It is a feather in the cap of any
ballad-editor after Professor Child to discover a ballad that escaped
his eye.</p>

<p>My thanks are also due to the Rev. Professor W.&nbsp;W. Skeat for
assistance generously given in connection with the ballad of
<i>Judas</i>; and, as before, to Mr. A.&nbsp;H. Bullen.</p>

BALLADS IN THE SECOND SERIES</a></h4>


<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> ballads in the present volume
have been classified roughly so as to fall under the heads
(i)&nbsp;Ballads of Superstition and of the Supernatural, including
Dirges (pp. 1-122); (ii)&nbsp;Ballads of Sacred Origin (pp. 123-154);
(iii)&nbsp;Ballads of Riddle and Repartee (pp. 155-181); and
(iv)&nbsp;a&nbsp;few ballads, otherwise almost unclassifiable, collected
under the title of ‘Fyttes of Mirth,’ or Merry Ballads (pp. 182 to
end).</p>


<h5 class = "section">I</h5>

<p>That the majority of the ballads in the first section are Scottish
can hardly cause surprise. Superstition lurks amongst the mountains and
in the corners of the earth. And, with one remarkable exception, all the
best lyrical work in these ballads of the supernatural is to be found in
the Scots. <i>Thomas Rymer</i>, <i>Tam Lin</i>, <i>The Wife of Usher’s
Well</i>, <i>Clerk Sanders</i>, and <i>The Dæmon Lover</i>, are perhaps
the most notable examples amongst the ballads proper, and <i>Fair Helen
of Kirconnell</i>, <i>The Twa Corbies</i>, and <i>Bonnie George
<span class = "pagenum">xi</span>
<a name = "pagexi" id = "pagexi"> </a>
Campbell</i> amongst the dirges. All these are known wherever poetry is
read.</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>‘For dulness, the creeping Saxons;</p>
<p>For beauty and amorousness, the Gaedhills.’</p>
</div>

<p>But the exception referred to above, <i>The Unquiet Grave</i>, is
true English, and yet lyrical, singing itself, like a genuine ballad, to
a tune as one reads.</p>

<p>The complete superstition hinted at in this ballad should perhaps be
stated more fully. It is obvious that excessive mourning is fatal to the
peace of the dead; but it is also to be noticed that it is almost
equally fatal to the mourner. The mourner in <i>The Unquiet Grave</i> is
refused the kiss demanded, as it will be fatal. <i>Clerk Sanders</i>, on
the other hand, has lost&mdash;if ever it possessed&mdash;any trace of
this doctrine. For Margret does not die; though she would have died had
she kissed him, we notice, and the kiss was demanded by her and refused
by him: and Clerk Sanders is only disturbed in his grave because he has
not got back his troth-plight. The method of giving this back&mdash;the
stroking of a wand&mdash;we have had before in <i>The Brown Girl</i>
(First Series, pp. 60-62, st.&nbsp;14).</p>

<p>In the Helgi cycle of Early Western epics (<i>Corpus Poeticum
Boreale</i>, vol.&nbsp;i. pp. 128&nbsp;ff.), Helgi the hero is slain,
and returns as a ghost to
<span class = "pagenum">xii</span>
<a name = "pagexii" id = "pagexii"> </a>
his lady, who follows him to his grave. But her tears are bad for him:
they fall in blood on his corpse.</p>

<p>The subject of the Lyke-wake would easily bear a monograph to itself,
and at present I know of none. I&nbsp;have therefore ventured, in
choosing Aubrey’s version in place of the better known one
printed&mdash;and doubtless written over&mdash;by Sir Walter Scott, to
give rather fuller information concerning the Dirge, its folklore, and
its bibliography. A&nbsp;short study of the ramifications of the various
superstitions incorporated therein leads to a sort of surprise that
there is no popular ballad treating of the subject of St. Patrick’s
Purgatory, which has attracted more than one English poet. Thomas
Wright’s volume on the subject, however, is delightful and instructive
reading.</p>


<h5 class = "section">II</h5>

<p>The short section of Ballads of Sacred Origin contains all that we
possess in England&mdash;notice that only two have Scottish variants,
even fragmentary&mdash;and somewhat more than can be classified as
ballads with strictness. Yet I would fain have added other of our
‘masterless’ carols, which to-day seem to survive chiefly in the West of
England. One of their best lovers, Mr. Quiller-Couch, has complained
that, after promising
<span class = "pagenum">xiii</span>
<a name = "pagexiii" id = "pagexiii"> </a>
himself to include a representative selection of carols in his
anthology, he was chagrined to discover that they lost their quaint
delicacy when placed among other more artificial lyrics. Perhaps they
would have been more at home set amongst these ballads; but I have
excluded them with the less regret in remembering that they stand well
alone in the collections of Sylvester, Sandys, Husk; in the reprints of
Thomas Wright; and, in more recent years, in the selections of Mr.
A.&nbsp;H. Bullen and Canon Beeching.</p>

<p><i>The Maid and the Palmer</i> would appear to be the only ballad of
Christ’s wanderings on the earth that we possess, just as <i>Brown
Robyn’s Confession</i> is the only one of the miracles of the Virgin.
One may guess, however, that others have descended rapidly into nursery
rhymes, as in the case of one, noted in J.&nbsp;O. Halliwell’s
collection, which, in its absence, may be called <i>The Owl, or the
Baker’s Daughter</i>. For Ophelia knew that they said the owl was the
baker’s daughter. And the story of her metamorphosis is exactly
paralleled by the Norse story of <i>Gertrude’s Bird</i>, translated by
Dasent.</p>

<p>Gertrude was an old woman with a red mutch on her head, who was
kneading dough, when Christ came wandering by, and asked for a small
<span class = "pagenum">xiv</span>
<a name = "pagexiv" id = "pagexiv"> </a>
bannock. Gertrude took a niggardly pinch of dough, and began to roll it
into a bannock; but as she rolled, it grew, until she put it aside as
too large to give away, and took a still smaller pinch. This also grew
miraculously, and was put aside. The same thing happened a third time,
till she said, ‘I cannot roll you a small bannock.’ Then Christ said,
‘For your selfishness, you shall become a bird, and seek your food
’twixt bark and bole.’ Gertrude at once became a bird, and flew up into
a tree with a screech. And to this day the great woodpecker of
Scandinavia is called ‘Gertrude’s Bird,’ and has a red head.</p>

<p>The Ballads of Riddle and Repartee do not amount to very many in our
tongue. But they contain riddles which may be found in one form or
another in nearly every folklore on the earth. Even Samson had a riddle.
Always popular, they seem to have been especial favourites in early
Oriental literature, in the mediæval Latin races, and, in slightly more
modern times, amongst the Teutonic and Scandinavian peoples. Perhaps
<i>King John and the Abbot</i> is the best English specimen, for it is
to-day as pleasing to an audience as it can ever have been. But <i>Lady
Isabel and the Elf Knight</i>, better known as <i>May
<span class = "pagenum">xv</span>
<a name = "pagexv" id = "pagexv"> </a>
Colvin</i>, is the most startling of any, in its myriad ramifications
and supposed origin.</p>


<h5 class = "section">IV</h5>

<p>The ‘Fyttes of Mirth’ conclude the present volume. It may be as well
to say here that I have placed under this head any ballad that tells of
a successful issue and has a happy ending or mirthful climax.</p>

<p>The version I have given of that famous ballad <i>The Lord of
Learne</i> (or, more commonly, <i>Lorne</i>) is most enchanting in its
<i>naïveté</i>, and, when read aloud or recited, is exceedingly
effective. The curious remark that the affectionate parting between the
young Lord and his father and mother would have changed even a Jew’s
heart; the picturesque description of the siege of the castle, so close
that ‘a&nbsp;swallow could not have flown away’; the sudden descent from
romance to a judicial trial; the remarkable assumption by the foreman of
the jury of the privileges of a judge; and the thoroughly satisfactory
description of the false steward’s execution&mdash;</p>

<p class = "verse">
‘I-wis they did him curstly cumber!’</p>

<p>&mdash;all these help to form the ever-popular <i>Lord of
Learne</i>.</p>

<p>The remaining ‘Fyttes of Mirth’ are mostly well known, and require no
further comment.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> late Professor York Powell
explained to me, since the note on ‘gare’ (First Series, p.&nbsp;1) was
written, that the word means exactly what is meant by ‘gore’ in modern
dressmaking. The antique skirt was made of four pieces: two cut square,
to form the front and the back; and two of a triangular shape, to fill
the space between, the apex of the triangle, of course, being at the
waist. Thus a knife that ‘hangs low down’ by a person’s ‘gare,’ simply
means that the knife hung at the side and not in front.</p>

THOMAS RYMER</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;The best-known text
of this famous ballad is that given by Scott in the <i>Minstrelsy of the
Scottish Border</i>, derived ‘from a copy obtained from a lady residing
not far from Erceldoune, corrected and enlarged by one in Mrs. Brown’s
<span class = "smallroman">MS</span>.’ Scott’s ballad is compounded,
therefore, of a traditional version, and the one here given, from the
Tytler-Brown <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, which was printed by
Jamieson with a few changes. It does not mention Huntlie bank or the
Eildon tree. Scott’s text may be seen printed parallel with Jamieson’s
in Professor J.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;H. Murray’s book referred to below.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;As early as the
fourteenth century there lived a Thomas of Erceldoune, or Thomas the
Rhymer, who had a reputation as a seer and prophet. His fame was not
extinct in the nineteenth century, and a collection of prophecies by him
and Merlin and others, first issued in 1603, could be found at the
beginning of that century ‘in most farmhouses in Scotland’ (Murray,
<i>The Romance and Prophecies of Thomas of Erceldoune</i>, E.E.T.S.,
1875). The existence of a Thomas de Ercildoun, son and heir of Thomas
Rymour de Ercildoun, both living during the thirteenth century, is
recorded in contemporary documents.</p>

<p>A poem, extant in five manuscripts (all printed by Murray as above),
of which the earliest was written about the middle of the fifteenth
century, relates that
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
<a name = "page2" id = "page2"> </a>
<ins class = "correction" title = "wording unchanged">Thomas of
Erceldoune his prophetic powers</ins> were given him by the Queen of
Elfland, who bore him away to her country for some years, and then
restored him to this world lest he should be chosen for the tribute paid
to hell. So much is told in the first fytte, which corresponds roughly
to our ballad. The rest of the poem consists of prophecies taught to him
by the Queen.</p>

<p>The poem contains references to a still earlier story, which probably
narrated only the episode of Thomas’s adventure in Elfland, and to which
the prophecies of Thomas Rymour of Ercildoun were added at a later date.
The story of Thomas and the Queen of Elfland is only another version of
a legend of Ogier le Danois and Morgan the Fay.</p>

<p>Our ballad is almost certainly derived directly from the poem, and
the version here given is not marred by the repugnant ending of Scott’s
ballad, where Thomas objects to the gift of a tongue that can never lie.
But Scott’s version retains Huntlie bank and the Eildon tree, both
mentioned in the old poem, and both exactly located during last century
at the foot of the Eildon Hills, above Melrose (see an interesting
account in Murray, <i>op. cit.</i>, Introduction, pp. l-lii and
footnotes).</p>

combing of hair seems to be a favourite method of expressing affection,
not only in these ballads, but also in Scandinavian folklore. It is
needless to take exception to the attribution either of hair to a worm,
or of knees to a machrel: though we may note that in one version of
<i>Dives and Lazarus</i> Dives ‘has a place prepared in hell to sit on a
serpent’s knee.’ However, it is probable that a part of the ballad, now

human shape by means of a kiss is a common tale in the Scandinavian
area; occasionally three kisses are necessary.</p>

<p>A similar ballad, now lost, but re-written by the contributor, from
scraps of recitation by an old woman in Berwickshire, localises the
story of the fire-drake (‘the laidly worm’) near Bamborough in
Northumberland; and Kinloch said that the term ‘Childe o’ Wane’ was
still applied by disconsolate damsels of Bamborough to any youth who
champions them. However, Mr. R.&nbsp;W. Clark of Bamborough, who has
kindly made inquiries for me, could find no survival of this use.</p>

WILLIE’S LADY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the lost
Fraser-Tytler-Brown <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, this ballad
luckily having been transcribed before the <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> disappeared. Mrs. Brown recited another and a
fuller version to Jamieson.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story.</span>&mdash;Willie’s mother,
a&nbsp;witch, displeased at her son’s choice, maliciously arrests by
witchcraft the birth of Willie’s son. Willie’s travailing wife sends him
again and again to bribe the witch, who refuses cup, steed, and girdle.
Here our version makes such abrupt transitions, that it will be well to
explain what takes place. The Belly Blind or Billie Blin (see <i>Young
Bekie</i>, First Series, pp. 6,&nbsp;7) advises Willie to make a sham
baby of wax, and invite his witch-mother to the christening. Willie does
so (in stanzas lost between our 33 and 34); the witch, believing the
wax-baby to be flesh and blood, betrays all her craft by asking who has
loosed the knots, ta’en out the kaims, ta’en down the woodbine, etc.,
these being the magic rites by which she has suspended birth. Willie
instantly looses the knots and takes out the kaims, and his wife
presents him with a bonny young son.</p>

<p>The story is common in Danish ballads, and occasional in Swedish. In
the classics, Juno (Hera) on two occasions delayed childbirth and
cheated Ilithyia, the sufferers being Latona and Alcmene. But the latest
version of the story is said to have occurred in Arran in the nineteenth
century. A&nbsp;young man, forsaking his sweetheart, married another
maiden, who when her time came suffered exceedingly.
<span class = "pagenum">20</span>
<a name = "page20" id = "page20"> </a>
A&nbsp;packman who chanced to be passing heard the tale and suspected
the cause. Going to the discarded sweetheart, he told her that her rival
had given birth to a fine child; thereupon she sprang up, pulled a large
nail out of the beam, and called to her mother, ‘Muckle good your craft
has done!’ The labouring wife was delivered forthwith. (See <i>The
Folklore Record</i>, vol.&nbsp;ii. p.&nbsp;117.)</p>

COSPATRICK</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is that of Scott’s
<i>Minstrelsy</i> (1802). It was ‘taken down from the recitation of a
lady’ (his mother’s sister, Miss Christian Rutherford), and collated
with a copy in the Tytler-Brown <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>
The ballad is also called <i>Gil Brenton</i>, <i>Lord Dingwall</i>,
<i>Bangwell</i>, <i>Bengwill</i>, or <i>Brangwill</i>, <i>Bothwell</i>,
etc.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is a great favourite, not
only in Scandinavian ballads, but also in all northern literature. The
magical agency of bed, blankets, sheets, and sword, is elsewhere
extended to a chair, a&nbsp;stepping-stone by the bedside (see the
<i>Boy and the Mantle</i>, First Series, p.&nbsp;119), or the Billie
Blin (see <i>Young Bekie</i>, First Series, pp. 6,&nbsp;7, and
<i>Willie’s Lady</i>, p.&nbsp;19). The Norwegian tale of Aase and the
Prince is known to English readers in Dasent’s <i>Annie the
Goosegirl</i>. The Prince is possessed of a stepping-stone by his
bedside, which answers his question night and morning, and enables him
to detect the supposititious bride. See also Jamieson’s translation of
<i>Ingefred and Gudrunè</i>, in <i>Illustrations of Northern
Antiquities</i>, p.&nbsp;340.</p>

YOUNG AKIN</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from Buchan’s
<i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>, and, like nearly all Buchan’s
versions, exhibits traces of vulgar remoulding. This ballad in
particular has lost much of the original features. Kinloch called his
version <i>Hynde Etin</i>, Allingham his compilation <i>Etin the
Forester</i>.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is given in a far finer
style in romantic Scandinavian ballads. Prior translated two of them,
<i>The Maid and the Dwarf-King</i>, and <i>Agnes and the Merman</i>,
both Danish. The Norse ballads on this subject, which may still be heard
sung, are exceptionally beautiful. Child says, ‘They should make an
Englishman’s heart wring for his loss.’</p>

<p>In the present version we may with some confidence attribute to
Buchan the stanzas from 48 to the end, as well as 15 and 16. The
preference is given to Buchan’s text merely because it retains features
lost in Kinloch’s version.</p>

CLERK COLVEN</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text.</span>&mdash;This ballad was one
of two transcribed from the now lost Tytler-Brown <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span>, and the transcript is given here.
A&nbsp;considerable portion of the story is lost between stanzas 6
and&nbsp;7.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> in its full form is found in
a German poem of the twelfth or thirteenth century (<i>Der Ritter von
Stauffenberg</i>) as well as in many Scandinavian ballads.</p>

<p>In the German tale, the fairy bound the knight to marry no one; on
that condition she would come to him whenever he wished, if he were
alone, and would bestow endless gifts upon him: if ever he did marry, he
would die within three days. Eventually he was forced to marry, and died
as he had been warned.</p>

<p>In seventy Scandinavian ballads, the story remains much the same. The
hero’s name is Oluf or Ole, or some modification of this, of which
‘Colvill,’ or ‘Colven,’ as we have it here, is the English equivalent.
Oluf, riding out, is accosted by elves or dwarfs, and one of them asks
him to dance with her. If he will, a&nbsp;gift is offered; if he will
not, a&nbsp;threat is made. Gifts and threats naturally vary in
different versions. He attempts to escape, is struck or stabbed fatally,
and rides home and dies. His bride is for some time kept in ignorance of
his death by various shifts, but at last discovers the truth, and her
heart breaks. Oluf’s mother dies also.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this account how much is lost in our ballad. But
it is evident that Clerk Colven’s lady has heard of his previous
acquaintance with the
<span class = "pagenum">44</span>
<a name = "page44" id = "page44"> </a>
mermaiden. This point survives only in four Färöe ballads out of the
seventy Scandinavian versions.</p>

<p>The story is also found in French, Breton, Spanish, etc.</p>

Johnson’s <i>Museum</i>, communicated by Burns. Scott’s version (1802),
<i>The Young Tamlane</i>, contained certain verses, ‘obtained from a

though the language is somewhat of a modern cast.’ &mdash;‘Of a grossly

</div>

corresponds very closely with the one here printed, doubtless owing to
Burns’s friendship with Riddell. Both probably were derived from one
common source.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;Although the ballad
as it stands is purely Scottish, its main feature, the retransformation
of Tam Lin, is found in popular mythology even before Homer’s time.</p>

<p>A Cretan ballad, taken down about 1820-30, relates that a young
peasant, falling in love with a nereid, was advised by an old woman to
seize his beloved by the hair just before cock-crow, and hold her fast,
whatever transformation she might undergo. He
<span class = "pagenum">48</span>
<a name = "page48" id = "page48"> </a>
did so; the nymph became in turn a dog, a&nbsp;snake, a&nbsp;camel, and
fire. In spite of all, he retained his hold; and at the next crowing of
the cock she regained her beauty, and accompanied him home. After a
year, in which she spoke no word, she bore a son. The peasant again
applied to the old woman for a cure, and was advised to tell his wife
that if she would not speak, he would throw the baby into the oven. On
his carrying out the old woman’s suggestion the nereid cried out, ‘Let
go my child, dog<ins class = "correction" title = "close quote invisible">!’&nbsp;</ins>tore her baby from him, and vanished.</p>

<p>This tale was current among the Cretan peasantry in 1820. Two
thousand years before, Apollodorus had told much the same story of
Peleus and Thetis (<i>Bibliotheca</i>, iii.&nbsp;13). The chief
difference is that it was Thetis who placed her son on the fire, to make
him immortal, and Peleus who cried out. <i>The Tayl of the yong
Tamlene</i> is mentioned in the <i>Complaint of Scotland</i> (1549).</p>

<p>Carterhaugh is about a mile from Selkirk, at the confluence of the
Ettrick and the Yarrow.</p>

<p>The significance of 34.<sup>3</sup>, ‘Then throw me into well water,’
is lost in the present version, by the position of the line <i>after</i>
the ‘burning gleed,’ as it seems the reciter regarded the well-water
merely as a means of extinguishing the gleed. But the immersion in water
has a meaning far deeper and more interesting than that. It is a
widespread and ancient belief in folklore that immersion in water (or
sometimes milk) is indispensable to the recovery of human shape, after
existence in a supernatural shape, or <i>vice versâ</i>. The version in
the Glenriddell <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> rightly gives it
as the <i>last</i> direction to Janet, to be adopted when the
transformations are at an end:&mdash;</p>

THE GREAT SILKIE OF SULE SKERRIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> was communicated to the
Society of Antiquaries of Scotland by Captain F.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;L. Thomas,
who took it down from the dictation of an old woman of Shetland.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is concerned with the
Finn-myth. The Finns live in the depths of the sea. ‘Their
transfiguration into seals seems to be more a kind of deception they
practise. For the males are described as most daring boatmen, with
powerful sweep of the oar, who chase foreign vessels on the sea.... By
means of a “skin” which they possess, the men and the women among them
are able to change themselves into seals. But on shore, after having
taken off the wrappage, they are, and behave like, real human beings....
Many a Finn woman has got into the power of a Shetlander, and borne
children to him; but if the Finn woman succeeded in re-obtaining her
sea-skin, or seal-skin, she escaped across the water’ (Karl Blind in the
<i>Contemporary Review</i>, September 1881, pp. 399-400). The same
writer, in quoting a verse of this ballad, says, ‘Shöol Skerry means
Seal’s Isle.’ The whole article is of great interest.</p>

<p>‘G. S. L.,’ the author of <i>Shetland Fireside Tales, or the Hermit
of Trosswickness</i> (1877), remarks: ‘The belief that witches and
wizards came from the coast of Norway disguised as seals was entertained
by many of the Shetland peasantry even so late as the beginning of the
present century.’ He goes on to
<span class = "pagenum">64</span>

prove the supernatural character of seals by relating an exploit of his
own, in which a gun pointed at a seal refused to go off.</p>

<p>Sule Skerrie is a lonely islet to the north-east of Cape Wrath, about
as far therefrom as from the Shetland Isles.</p>

<p>Another version of this ballad, unknown to Child, is given in the

YOUNG HUNTING</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from two copies in
Herd’s <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> as collated by Child, with
the exception of two lines, 9.<sup>3,4</sup>, which are taken from a
third and shorter copy in Herd’s <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>,
printed by him in the <i>Scottish Songs</i>. Scott’s ballad, <i>Earl
Richard</i>, is described by him as made up from the above-mentioned
copies of Herd, with some trivial alterations adopted from
tradition&mdash;a&nbsp;totally inadequate account of wholesale
alterations. Scott also gives a similar ballad in <i>Lord
William</i>.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;Young Hunting,
a&nbsp;king’s son, tells a former mistress that he has a new sweetheart
whom he loves thrice as well. The lady conceals her anger, plies him
with wine, and slays him in his drunken sleep. Her deed unluckily is
overseen by a bonny bird, whom she attempts to coax into captivity, but
fails. She dresses Young Hunting for riding, and throws him into the
Clyde. The king his father asks for him. She swears by corn (see First
Series, <i>Glasgerion</i>, p.&nbsp;1) that she has not seen him since
yesterday at noon. The king’s divers search for him in vain, until the
bonny bird reminds them of the method of finding a drowned corpse by the
means of candles. The lady still denies her guilt, and accuses her maid
‘Catheren,’ but the bonfire refuses to consume the innocent Catheren.
When the real culprit is put in, she burns like hoky-gren.</p>

<p>The discovery of a drowned body by candles is a recognised piece of
folklore. Usually the candle is stuck in a loaf of bread or on a cork,
and set afloat in
<span class = "pagenum">75</span>
<a name = "page75" id = "page75"> </a>
the river; sometimes a hole is cut in a loaf of bread and mercury poured
in to weight it; even a chip of wood is used. The superstition still
survives. The most rational explanation offered is that as eddies in
rapid streams form deep pools, in which a body might easily be caught,
so a floating substance indicates the place by being caught in the
centre of the eddy.</p>

<p>The failure of the fire to burn an innocent maid is also, of course,
a&nbsp;well-known incident.</p>

THE THREE RAVENS<br>
and<br>
THE TWA CORBIES</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Texts</span> of these two variations on
the same theme are taken from T.&nbsp;Ravenscroft’s <i>Melismata</i>,
1611, and Scott’s <i>Minstrelsy</i>, 1803, respectively. There are
several other versions of the Scots ballad, while Motherwell prints
<i>The Three Ravens</i>, changing only the burden.</p>

<p>Chappell (<i>Popular Music of the Olden Time</i>) says of the English
version that he has been ‘favored with a variety of copies of it,
written down from memory; and all differing in some respects, both as to
words and tune, but with sufficient resemblance to prove a similar
origin.’ Consciously or not, the ballad, as set by him to its
traditional tune, is to be sung without the threefold repetition shown
by Ravenscroft, thus compressing two verses of the ballad into each
repetition of the tune, and halving the length of the song.</p>

YOUNG BENJIE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from Scott’s
<i>Minstrelsy</i> (1803). He remarks, ‘The ballad is given from
tradition.’ No. 29 in the Abbotsford <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span>, ‘Scotch Ballads, Materials for Border
Minstrelsy,’ is <i>Young Benjie</i> (or Boonjie as there written) in
thirteen stanzas, headed ‘From Jean Scott,’ and written in William
Laidlaw’s hand. All of this except the first stanza is transferred, with
or without changes, to Scott’s ballad, which is nearly twice as
long.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> of this ballad, simple in
itself, introduces to us the elaborate question of the ‘lyke-wake,’ or
the practice of watching through the night by the side of a corpse. More
about this will be found under <i>The Lyke-Wake Dirge</i>, and in the
Appendix at the end of this volume. Here it will suffice to quote Sir
Walter Scott’s introduction:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘In this ballad the reader will find traces of a singular
superstition, not yet altogether discredited in the wilder parts of
Scotland. The lykewake, or watching a dead body, in itself a melancholy
office, is rendered, in the idea of the assistants, more dismally awful,
by the mysterious horrors of superstition. In the interval betwixt death
and interment, the disembodied spirit is supposed to hover around its
mortal habitation, and, if provoked by certain rites, retains the power
of communicating, through its organs, the cause of its dissolution. Such
enquiries, however, are always dangerous, and never to be resorted to
unless the deceased is suspected to have suffered <i>foul play</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">84</span>
<a name = "page84" id = "page84"> </a>
as it is called.... One of the most potent ceremonies in the charm, for
causing the dead body to speak, is setting the door ajar, or half open.
On this account, the peasants of Scotland sedulously avoid leaving the
door ajar while a corpse lies in the house. The door must either be left
wide open or quite shut; but the first is always preferred, on account
of the exercise of hospitality usual on such occasions. The attendants
must be likewise careful never to leave the corpse for a moment alone,
or, if it is left alone, to avoid, with a degree of superstitious
horror, the first sight of it.’ &mdash;(Ed. 1803, vol. iii. pp.
251-2.)</p>

THE LYKE-WAKE DIRGE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given <i>verbatim et
literatim</i> from John Aubrey’s <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>
of his <i>Remains of Gentilisme &amp; Judaisme</i> (1686-7) in the
Lansdowne <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span>, No. 231, folio 114
<i>recto</i> and <i>verso</i>. This text has often been printed before
(see <a href = "#appendix2">Appendix</a>), but always with errors. The
only change made here is the placing of Aubrey’s marginal notes among
the footnotes: the spelling is Aubrey’s spelling. The present version
was obtained by Aubrey in 1686 from an informant whose father had heard
it sung sixty years previously.</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott’s text, better known than Aubrey’s, presents very
few variations, the chief being ‘sleete’ for ‘fleet’ in 1.<sup>3</sup>
(see below). This would seem to point to the fact that Scott obtained
his version from a manuscript, and confused the antique ‘ſ’ (=&nbsp;s)
with&nbsp;‘f.’ A&nbsp;collation, incomplete and inexact, of the two
texts is given by T.&nbsp;F. Henderson in his edition of the
<i>Minstrelsy</i> (1902), vol. iii. pp. 170-2.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;This dirge, of
course, is not a ballad in the true sense of the word. But it is
concerned with myths so widespread and ancient, that as much could be
written about the dirge as almost any one of the ballads proper.
I&nbsp;have added an Appendix at the end of this volume, to which those
interested in the subject may refer. For the present, the following
account may suffice.</p>

<p>Ritson found an illustration of this dirge in a manuscript letter,
written by one signing himself ‘H.&nbsp;Tr.’ to Sir Thomas Chaloner, in
the Cotton <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> (Julius, F.&nbsp;vi.,
<span class = "pagenum">89</span>
<a name = "page89" id = "page89"> </a>
fols. 453-462). The date approximately is the end of the sixteenth
century (Sir Thomas Chaloner the elder, 1521-1565; the younger,
1561-1615). The letter is concerned with antiquities in Durham and
Yorkshire, especially near Guisborough, an estate of the Chaloner
family. The sentence referring to the Lyke-Wake Dirge was printed by
Scott, to whom it was communicated by Ritson’s executor after his death.
It is here given as re-transcribed from the manuscript (f.&nbsp;461
<i>verso</i>).</p>

<p>‘When any dieth, certaine women singe a songe to the dead body,
recytinge the iorney that the partie deceased must goe, and they are of
beleife (such is their fondnesse) that once in their liues yt is good to
giue a payre of newe shoes to a poore man; forasmuch as after this life
they are to pass barefoote through a greate launde full of thornes &amp;
furzen, excepte by the meryte of the Almes aforesaid they have redeemed
their forfeyte; for at the edge of the launde an aulde man shall meete
them with the same shoes that were giuen by the partie when he was
liuinge, and after he hath shodde them he dismisseth them to goe through
thicke and thin without scratch or scalle.’</p>

<p>The myth of Hell-shoon (Norse, <i>helsko</i>) appears under various
guises in many folklores. (See <a href = "#appendix2">Appendix</a>.)</p>

<p>Sir Walter Scott, in printing ‘sleete’ in 1.<sup>3</sup>, said: ‘The
word <i>sleet</i>, in the chorus,<a class = "tag" name = "tag1" id =
"tag1" href = "#note1">1</a> seems to be corrupted from <i>selt</i>, or
salt; a&nbsp;quantity of which, in compliance with a popular
superstition, is frequently placed on the breast of a corpse.’ It is
true that a superstition to this effect does exist: but ‘fleet’ is
doubtless the right reading. Aubrey glosses it as ‘water’; but Murray
has shown (<i>New English Dictionary, s.v.</i>), by
<span class = "pagenum">90</span>
<a name = "page90" id = "page90"> </a>
three quotations from wills dated between 1533 and 1570, that ‘fire and
flet’ is an expression meaning simply ‘fire and house-room.’ ‘Flet,’ in
short, is our modern ‘flat’ in an unspecialised and uncorrupted
form.</p>

THE BONNY EARL OF MURRAY</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from Allan
Ramsay’s <i>Tea-Table Miscellany</i>, where it first appeared in the
tenth edition (1740) in vol. iv. pp. 356-7. Child had not seen this, and
gave his text from the eleventh edition of 1750. There is, however,
scarcely any difference.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> of the murder of the Earl of
Murray by the Earl of Huntly in February 1592 is found in several
histories and other accounts:&mdash; <i>The History of the Church of
Scotland</i> (1655) by John Spottiswoode, Archbishop of Glasgow and of
St. Andrews: <i>History of the Western Highlands and Isles of
Scotland</i> (1836) by Donald Gregory: <i>The History and Life of King
James</i> (the Sixth), ed. T.&nbsp;Thomson, Bannatyne Club, (1825):
<i>Extracts from the Diarey of R</i>[<i>obert</i>]<i>
B</i>[<i>irrel</i>]<i>, Burges of Edinburgh</i> (?&nbsp;1820): and Sir
Walter Scott’s <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>. The following condensed
account may suffice:&mdash;James Stewart, son of Sir James Stewart of
Doune (‘Down,’ 6.<sup>2</sup>), Earl of Murray by his marriage with the
heiress of the Regent Murray, ‘was a comely personage, of a great
stature, and strong of body like a kemp,’ whence he was generally known
as the Bonny Earl of Murray. In the last months of 1591, a&nbsp;rumour
reached the King’s ears that the Earl of Murray had assisted in, or at
least countenanced, the attack recently made on Holyrood House by
Stewart, Earl of Bothwell; and Huntly was commissioned to arrest Murray
and bring him to trial. Murray, apprehended at Donibristle (or
Dunnibirsel), his mother the Lady Doune’s house, refused to surrender
<span class = "pagenum">93</span>
<a name = "page93" id = "page93"> </a>
to his feudal enemy the Earl of Huntly, and the house was fired. Murray,
after remaining behind the rest of his party, rushed out and broke
through the enemy, but was subsequently discovered (by the plumes on his
headpiece, which had caught fire) and mortally wounded. Tradition says
that Huntly was compelled by his followers to incriminate himself in the
deed, and struck the dying Murray in the face, whereat the bonny Earl
said, ‘You have spoiled a better face than your own.’</p>

Campbell of Calder killed in a feud with Campbell of Ardkinglas, the
murder being the result of the same conspiracy which brought the Bonny
Earl of Murray to his death. Another version of the ballad, however,
gives the name as James, and it is useless and unnecessary to

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> of the ballad is given in
the two above-mentioned books from tradition as follows. Fair Helen, of
the clan of Irving or Bell, favoured Adam Fleming (Fleeming) with her
love; another suitor, whose name is said to have been Bell, was the
choice of the lady’s family and friends. The latter lover becoming
jealous, concealed himself in the bushes of the banks of the Kirtle,
which flows by the kirkyard of Kirconnell, where the true lovers were
accustomed to walk. Being discovered lurking there by Helen, he levelled
his carbine at Adam Fleming. Helen, however, threw herself into her
lover’s arms, and received the bullet intended for him: whereupon he
slew his rival. He went abroad to Spain and fought against the infidels,
but being still inconsolable, returned to Kirconnell, perished on
Helen’s grave, and was buried beside her. The tombstone, bearing a sword
and a cross, with <i>Hic jacet Adamus Fleming</i>, is still (says Scott)
shown in the churchyard of Kirconnell.</p>

SIR HUGH, OR THE JEW’S DAUGHTER</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from Jamieson’s
<i>Popular Ballads</i>, as taken down by him from Mrs. Brown’s
recitation.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> of the ballad is told at
length in at least two ancient monastic records; in the <i>Annals of the
Monastery of Waverley</i>, the first Cistercian house in England, near
Farnham, Surrey (edited by Luard, vol. ii. p.&nbsp;346, etc., from <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span> Cotton Vesp, A.&nbsp;xvi. fol. 150,
etc.); more fully in the <i>Annals of the Monastery at
Burton-on-Trent</i>, Staffordshire (edited by Luard, vol. i. pp. 340,
etc., from <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> Cotton Vesp. E. iii.
fol. 53, etc.). Both of these give the date as 1255, the latter adding
July 31. Matthew Paris also tells the tale as a contemporary event. The
details may be condensed as follows.</p>

<p>All the principal Jews in England being collected at the end of July
1255 at Lincoln, Hugh, a&nbsp;schoolboy, while playing with his
companions (<i>jocis ac choreis</i>) was by them kidnapped, tortured,
and finally crucified. His body was then thrown into a stream, but the
water, <i>tantam sui Creatoris injuriam non ferens</i>, threw the corpse
back on to the land. The Jews then buried it; but it was found next
morning above-ground. Finally it was thrown into a well, which at once
was lit up with so brilliant a light and so sweet an odour, that word
went forth of a miracle. Christians came to see, discovered the body
floating on the surface, and drew it up. Finding the hands and feet to
be pierced, the head ringed with bleeding scratches, and the body
otherwise wounded, it was at once clear
<span class = "pagenum">108</span>
<a name = "page108" id = "page108"> </a>
to all <i>tanti sceleris auctores detestandos fuisse Judaeos</i>,
eighteen of whom were subsequently hanged.</p>

<p>Other details may be gleaned from various accounts. The name of the
Jew into whose house the boy was taken is given as Copin or Jopin. Hugh
was eight or nine years old. Matthew Paris adds the circumstance of
Hugh’s mother (Beatrice by name) seeking and finding him.</p>

<p>The original story has obviously become contaminated with others
(such as Chaucer’s <i>Prioresses Tale</i>) in the course of six hundred
and fifty years. But the central theme, the murder of a child by the
Jews, is itself of great antiquity; and similar charges are on record in
Europe even in the nineteenth century. Further material for the study of
this ballad may be found in Francisque Michel’s <i>Hugh de Lincoln</i>
(1839), and J.&nbsp;O. Halliwell [-Phillipps]’s <i>Ballads and Poems
respecting Hugh of Lincoln</i> (1849).</p>

<p>Percy in the <i>Reliques</i> (1765), vol. i. p.&nbsp;32, says:&mdash;
‘If we consider, on the one hand, the ignorance and superstition of the
times when such stories took their rise, the virulent prejudices of the
monks who record them, and the eagerness with which they would be
catched up by the barbarous populace as a pretence for plunder; on the
other hand, the great danger incurred by the perpetrators, and the
inadequate motives they could have to excite them to a crime of so much
horror, we may reasonably conclude the whole charge to be groundless and
malicious.’</p>

<p>The tune ‘as sung by the late Mrs. Sheridan’ may be found in John
Stafford Smith’s <i>Musica Antiqua</i> (1812), vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;65,
and Motherwell’s <i>Minstrelsy</i>, tune No.&nbsp;7.</p>

THE DÆMON LOVER</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from Kinloch’s <span

T.&nbsp;Kinnear, Stonehaven.’ Child remarks of it that ‘probably by the
fortunate accident of being a fragment’ it ‘leaves us to put our own
construction upon the weird seaman; and, though it retains the homely
ship-carpenter, is on the whole the most satisfactory of all the
versions.’</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is told more elaborately in
a broadside, and resembles <i>Enoch Arden</i> in a certain degree. James
Harris, a&nbsp;seaman, plighted to Jane Reynolds, was captured by a
press-gang, taken overseas, and, after three years, reported dead and
buried in a foreign land. After a respectable interval,
a&nbsp;ship-carpenter came to Jane Reynolds, and eventually wedded her,
and the loving couple had three pretty children. One night, however, the
ship-carpenter being on a three days’ journey, a&nbsp;spirit came to the
window, and said that his name was James Harris, and that he had come to
take her away as his wife. She explains that she is married, and would
not have her husband know of this visit for five hundred pounds. James
Harris, however, said he had seven ships upon the sea; and when she
heard these ‘fair tales,’ she succumbed, went away with him, and ‘was
never seen no more.’ The ship-carpenter on his return hanged
himself.</p>

<p>Scott’s ballad in the <i>Minstrelsy</i> spoils its own effect by
converting the spirit into the devil. An American

genuine Scots tradition. In Wager’s comedy <i>The Longer thou Lived the
more Fool thou art</i> (about 1568) Moros sings a burden:&mdash;</p>

<p>Brome, brome on Hive hill,</p>
<p>The gentle brome on Hive hill,</p>
<p>The brome stands on Hive hill&nbsp;a.’</p>
</div>

<p>Before this date ‘Brume, brume on hil’ is mentioned in <i>The
Complaynt of Scotlande</i>, 1549; and a similar song was among Captain
Cox’s ‘ballets and songs, all auncient.’</p>

<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span>, of a youth challenging a
maid, and losing his wager by being laid asleep with witchcraft, is
popular and widespread. In the <i>Gesta Romanorum</i> is a story of
which this theme is one main incident, the other being the well-known
forfeit of a pound of flesh, as in the <i>Merchant of Venice</i>. Ser
Giovanni (<i>Pecorone</i>, <span class = "smallroman">IV.</span>&nbsp;1)
tells a similar tale, and other variations are found in narrative or
ballad form in Iceland, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, and Germany.</p>

(gall on the wild rose), if laid beneath a man’s pillow, causes him to
sleep until it be taken away.</p>

SAINT STEPHEN AND KING HEROD</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from the same
manuscript as the last. This manuscript is ascribed, from the style of
handwriting, to the reign of Henry <span class = "smallroman">VI.</span>
The ballad is there written without division into stanzas in twenty-four
long lines.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;The miraculous
resuscitation of a roast fowl (generally a cock, as here), in
confirmation of an incredible prophecy, is a tale found in nearly all
European countries. Originally, we find, the miracle is connected with
the Passion, not the Nativity. See the <a href = "#page133"><i>Carnal
and the Crane</i></a>.</p>

<p>An interpolation in a late Greek <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> of the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus relates
that Judas, having failed to induce the Jews to take back the thirty
pieces of silver, went home to hang himself, and found his wife roasting
a cock. On his demand for a rope to hang himself, she asked why he
intended to do so; and he told her he had betrayed his master Jesus to
evil men, who would kill him; yet he would rise again on the third day.
His wife was incredulous, and said, ‘Sooner shall this cock, roasting
over the coals, crow again’; whereat the cock napped his wings and crew
thrice. And Judas, confirmed in the truth, straightway made a noose in
the rope, and hanged himself.</p>

<p>Thence the miracle-tale spread over Europe. In a Spanish version not
only the cock crows, but his partner the hen lays an egg, in
asseveration of the truth. The tale is generally connected with the
<span class = "pagenum">126</span>
<a name = "page126" id = "page126"> </a>
legend of the Pilgrims of St. James; so in French, Spanish, Dutch,
Wendish, and Breton ballads.</p>

<p>In 1701 there was printed in London a broadside sheet of carols,
headed with a woodcut of the Nativity, by the side of which is printed:
‘A&nbsp;religious man, inventing the conceits of both birds and beasts
drawn in the picture of our Saviour’s birth, doth thus express
them:&mdash; The cock croweth <i>Christus natus est</i>, Christ is born.
The raven asked <i>Quando?</i> When? The crow replied <i>Hac nocte</i>,
This night. The ox cryeth out <i>Ubi? Ubi?</i> Where? where? The sheep
bleated out <i>Bethlehem</i>’ (Hone’s <i>Every-day Book</i>).</p>

elsewhere (as in the original), dates from the palm-tree; and again,
a&nbsp;fig-tree.</p>

THE CARNAL AND THE CRANE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from Sandys’
<i>Christmas Carols</i>, where it is printed from a broadside. The only
alterations, in which I have followed Professor Child, are the obvious
correction of ‘east’ for ‘west’ (8.<sup>1</sup>), and the insertion of
one word in 16.<sup>2</sup>, where Child says ‘perhaps a preposition has
been dropped.’</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is compounded of popular
legends connected with the life and miracles of Christ. For the miracle
of the cock, see <a href = "#page125"><i>Saint Stephen and King
Herod</i></a>. The adoration of the beasts is derived from the
<i>Historia de Nativitate Mariæ</i>, and is repeated in many legends of
the infancy of Christ, but is not sufficiently remarkable in itself to
be popular in carols. The origin of the miracle of the harvest is
unknown, though in a Breton ballad it forms one of the class known as
the miracles of the Virgin (cp. <i>Brown Robyn’s Confession</i>).
Swedish, Provençal, Catalan, Wendish, and Belgian folk-tales record
similar legends.</p>

<p>It is much to be regretted that this ballad, which from internal
evidence (<i>e.g.</i> the use of the word ‘renne,’&nbsp;1.<sup>2</sup>)
is to be attributed to an early age, should have become so incoherent
and corrupted by oral tradition. No manuscript or printed copy is known
earlier than about 1750, when it occurs in broadside form. The very word
‘Carnal’ has lapsed from the dictionaries, though somewhere it may
survive in speech. Stanza 17 is obviously out of place; one may suspect
gaps on either side, for surely more beasts than the ‘lovely lion’ were
enumerated, and a new section begins at stanza&nbsp;18.</p>

DIVES AND LAZARUS</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from Joshua
Sylvester’s <i>A&nbsp;Garland of Christmas Carols</i>, where it is
printed from an old Birmingham broadside.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is one which naturally
attracted the attention of the popular ballad-maker, and parallel
ballads exist in fairly wide European distribution.</p>

<p>Like the <i>Carnal and the Crane</i>, the form in which this ballad
is now known is no witness of its antiquity. A&nbsp;‘ballet of the Ryche
man and poor Lazarus’ was licensed to be printed in 1558;
‘a&nbsp;ballett, Dyves and Lazarus,’ in 1570-1.</p>

<p>In Fletcher’s <i>Monsieur Thomas</i> (1639), a&nbsp;fiddler says he
can sing the merry ballad of <i>Diverus and Lazarus</i>.
A&nbsp;correspondent in <i>Notes and Queries</i> (ser. <span class =
"smallroman">IV.</span> iii. 76) says he had heard only Diverus, never
Dives, and contributes from memory a version as sung by carol-singers at
Christmas in Worcestershire, in which the parallelism of the stanzas is
pushed so far that, in the lines corresponding to 13.<sup>3</sup> and
13.<sup>4</sup> in the present version, we have the delightfully popular
idea&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse intro">
<p>‘There is a place prepared in hell,</p>

<p>Husk (<i>Songs of the Nativity</i>) also gives this version, from an
eighteenth-century Worcestershire broadside. I&nbsp;have no doubt but
that this feature is traditional from the unknown sixteenth-century
ballad.</p>

JUDAS</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is given from a
thirteenth-century <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> in the library
of Trinity College, Cambridge (B.&nbsp;14, 39): it is thus the earliest
text of any ballad that we possess. In the <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span> it is written in long lines, four (or six, as in
4, 12, and 14) to the stanza.</p>

<p>As the language in which it is written is not easily intelligible,
I&nbsp;have added a paraphrase on the opposite pages.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is of great interest, as it
adds to the various legends of Judas a ‘swikele’ sister. The treachery
of Judas has long been popularly explained (from the Gospel of St. John,
xii. 3-6) as follows:&mdash; Judas, being accustomed as bearer of the
bag to take a tithe of all moneys passing through his hands, considered
that he had lost thirty pence on the ointment that might have been sold
for three hundred pence, and so took his revenge.</p>

<p>A Wendish ballad makes him lose the thirty pieces of silver,
intrusted to him for buying bread, in gambling with certain Jews, who,
when he had lost everything, suggested that he should sell his Master.
Afterwards, in remorse, he rushes away to hang himself. The fir-tree is
soft wood and will not bear him. The aspen is hard wood, and will bear
him; so he hangs himself on the aspen. Since when, the aspen always
trembles in fear of the Judgement day.</p>

THE MAID AND THE PALMER</h4>

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is well known in the
folklore of Europe, and is especially common in the Scandinavian
languages. As a rule, however, all these ballads blend the story of the
woman of Samaria with the traditions concerning Mary Magdalen that were
extant in mediæval times.</p>

<p>From the present ballad it could hardly be gathered (except, perhaps,
from stanza&nbsp;11) that the old palmer represents Christ. This point
is at once obvious in the Scandinavian and other ballads.</p>

<p>The extraordinary burden in the English ballad is one of the most
elaborate in existence, and is quite as inexplicable as any.</p>

<p>The expression ‘to lead an ape in hell’ (14.<sup>2</sup>) occurs
constantly in Elizabethan and later literature, always in connection
with women who die, or expect to die, unmarried. Dyce says the
expression ‘never has been (and <i>never will be</i>) satisfactorily
explained’; but it was suggested by Steevens that women who had no mate
on earth should adopt in hell an ape as a substitute.</p>

LADY ISABEL AND THE ELF-KNIGHT</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is taken from Buchan’s
<i>Ballads of the North of Scotland</i>, where it is entitled <i>The
Gowans sae gay</i>. This ballad is much better known in another form,
<i>May Colvin</i> (<i>Collin</i>, <i>Collean</i>).</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;Professor Child says,
‘Of all ballads this has perhaps obtained the widest circulation,’ and
devotes thirty-two pages to its introduction. Known in the south as well
as in the north of Europe, the Germans and Scandinavians preserve it in
fuller and more ancient forms than the Latin nations.</p>

<p>In the still popular Dutch ballad <i>Halewijn</i>, Heer Halewijn
sings so sweetly that the king’s daughter asks leave to go to him. Her
father, mother, and sister remind her that those who have gone to him
have never returned; her brother says he does not care where she goes,
if she retains her honour. She makes an elaborate toilet, takes the best
horse in the king’s stables, and joins Halewijn in the wood. They ride
till they come to a gallows with many women hanged upon it. Halewijn
offers her the choice of the means of her death, because she is fairest
of all. She says she will choose the sword, but that Halewijn had better
take off his coat, as it would be a pity to splash it with her blood. As
he takes it off, she cuts off his head, which, however, continues to
talk, suggesting she should blow his horn to warn his friends. She does
not fall into this rather obvious trap, nor will she agree to his
suggestion that she should rub his neck with a certain ointment. As she
rides home, she meets
<span class = "pagenum">156</span>
<a name = "page156" id = "page156"> </a>
Halewijn’s mother, and tells her he is dead. She is received back with
great honour and affection in her father’s castle.</p>

<p>This is the best form of the story, but many others only a little
less full are found in Flanders, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Iceland,
Germany (nearly thirty variants which fall into three main divisions
found respectively in North-West, South, and North-East Germany), Poland
(where it is extraordinarily common), Bohemia, Servia, France, North
Italy, Spain, and Portugal; and a Magyar ballad bears a certain
resemblance. On the whole, the English ballad here printed (but not
<i>May Colvin</i>) and the Danish, Swedish, and Norwegian ballads, would
seem to be the best preserved, on account of their retention of the
primary notion, that the maid first charms the knight to sleep and then
binds him. In <i>May Colvin</i> and many of the other European versions,
the knight bids her strip off her gown; she asks him to turn away his
face as she does so, and when he is not looking, she pushes him into the
river or sea.</p>

<p>The remarkable likeness existing between the names of the knight in
the many languages, <i>e.g.</i> Halewijn (<i>Dutch</i>), Ulver, Olmar,
Hollemen (<i>Danish</i>), Olbert (<i>German</i>), and Elf-knight in
English, has caused some speculation as to a common origin. Professor
Bugge has gone so far as to conjecture that the whole story is an
offshoot of the tale of Judith and Holofernes, the latter name being the
originals of the variants given above. While this hypothesis is perhaps
too startling to be accepted without further evidence, it must be
allowed that there are resemblances in the two stories; and as for the
metamorphosis of Holofernes into Halewijn or Olbert, it is at once
apparent that such changes are quite within the possibilities of
phonetic tradition; and any one who is unwilling to
<span class = "pagenum">157</span>
<a name = "page157" id = "page157"> </a>
credit this should recollect the Scottish ‘keepach’ and ‘dreeach’ (used
together or separately), which are derived, almost beyond belief, from
‘hypochondriac.’</p>

<p><i>May Colvin</i> is one of the few ancient ballads still kept in
print in broadside form.</p>

A NOBLE RIDDLE WISELY EXPOUNDED</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from a broadside of the
seventeenth century from the press of Coles, Vere, Wright, and Clarke,

<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> of this ballad is one of the
common class of riddle-ballads. Some of these riddles are found also in
<i>Captain Wedderburn</i>.</p>

<p>It is not clear why in 18.<sup>1</sup> ‘poyson is greener than the
grass.’ In <i>Captain Wedderburn</i> (17.<sup>1</sup>) it is ‘death’
that is greener than the grass, which is equally inexplicable.
A&nbsp;variant of the latter gives ‘virgus’ [=&nbsp;verjuice],
a&nbsp;kind of vinegar, which obviously means ‘green juice.’ It is
possible that this might come to be regarded as a synonym for ‘poyson’;
and the next step is to substitute ‘death’ for ‘poyson.’</p>

KING JOHN AND THE ABBOT</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> here printed is taken from
Percy’s <i>Reliques</i> (1765), vol. ii. p.&nbsp;302, etc. He compiled
his ballad from a broadside and another copy, <i>Kinge John and
Bishoppe</i>, that he found in his Folio <span class =
"smallroman">MS.</span>; and since he made it a much more readable
ballad than either of his originals, it is reproduced here.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;Riddles asked by a
monarch of one of his dependants, and answered by a third person
assuming the guise of the person questioned, form the subject of many
ancient tales. In Sacchetti’s <i>Novelle</i> we find both the abbot and
his representative, a&nbsp;miller, who answers Bernabò Visconti the four
questions, How far is it to heaven? How much water is there in the sea?
What is going on in hell? What is the value of my person? The answers to
the first two of these are given simply in large numbers and Bernabò
told to measure for himself if he does not believe them. The value of
Bernabò’s person is estimated, as in our ballad, at one piece less than
our Lord.</p>

<p>Another favourite question in these ballads is, Where is the centre
of the earth? The answer is given by the man planting his staff and
saying, ‘Here: prove it wrong if you can.’</p>

<p>In the Percy Folio version, the shepherd is the half-brother of the
abbot.</p>

THE LORD OF LEARNE</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> is from the Percy Folio
<span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, with the spelling modernised,
except in two or three instances for the sake of the rhyme
(13.<sup>4</sup>) or metre (102.<sup>2</sup>). Other alterations, as
suggested by Child, are noted. Apart from the irregularities of metre,
this ballad is remarkable for the large proportion of ‘e’ rhymes, which
are found in 71 stanzas, or two-thirds of the whole. The redundant
‘that,’ which is a feature of the Percy Folio, also occurs
frequently&mdash;in eleven places, three of which are in optative
sentences (8.<sup>2</sup>, 14.<sup>4</sup>, 91.<sup>4</sup>).</p>

<p>The ballad is more commonly known as <i>The Lord of Lorne</i>, under
which title we find it registered in the Stationers’ Company on October
6, 1580. Guilpin refers to it in his <i>Skialethia</i> (1598),
Satire&nbsp;1, ll. 107-108:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse intro">
<p>‘... the old ballad of the Lord of Lorne</p>
<p>Whose last line in King Harry’s day was born.’</p>
</div>

<p>Probably this implies little more than that the ballad was known in
Henry <span class = "smallroman">VIII.</span>’s day. Three broadsides
are known, two in the Roxburghe and one in the Pepys collection. Both
the Roxburghe ballads are later than the Folio version.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> is derived from that of
<i>Roswall and Lillian</i>. Roswall, the king’s son, of Naples,
overhearing three lords bewailing their long imprisonment, promised to
set them free, and did so by stealing the keys from under the king’s
pillow at night. The king, on hearing of their escape, vowed to slay at
sight the man who had set them free. The queen,
<span class = "pagenum">183</span>
<a name = "page183" id = "page183"> </a>
however, interceding for her son, Roswall was banished under charge of a
steward. From this point our ballad follows the romance fairly closely.
Roswall and the steward, after changing places, entered the kingdom of
Bealm. At length Roswall, under the name Dissawar (see <a href =
"#learne_29">29.<sup>2</sup></a>, etc.), became chamberlain to the
Princess Lillian, and she fell in love with him. The King of Bealm
meanwhile sent to the King of Naples, proposing to wed his daughter to
the young prince of Naples, and the Neapolitan king assented.
A&nbsp;joust was proclaimed, and Lillian told Dissawar to joust for her;
but he preferred to go a-hunting. However, in the wood he found the
three knights he had helped to escape, and they equipped him for the
three days’ tourney, in which he defeated the steward. He did not,
however, proclaim himself, and Lillian was forced to ask the king
herself for Dissawar; but her father married her to the steward. During
the wedding feast the three Neapolitan lords appeared, but would not
acknowledge the steward as their prince, and went in search of Roswall,
who told the king of the steward’s treachery, and announced himself to
be the victor of the jousts. The steward was hanged and Roswall married
to Lillian.</p>

<p>Other romances and stories exist, with similar foundations,
especially amongst the Slavic nations. But the best known is the
<i>Goose-girl</i> (<i>Die Gänse-magd</i>) of the Grimms, where the sexes
are reversed. A&nbsp;connection may be traced between the horse Falada’s
head and the gelding of the ballad; and the trick of a person, who is
sworn to secrecy, divulging the secret to some object (as the gelding,
here; but more often a stove or oven) in the presence of witnesses has
obtained a wide vogue.</p>

six broadsides printed between 1672 and 1700: they do not, however,

certainly misplaced; and the last stanza is quite superfluous. It would
be much more in keeping with ballad-style to end with the twelfth, and
many of the variants now sung conclude thus. This ballad is still
extremely popular, and not only has it been included in many selections

KING ORFEO</h4>


<p><span class = "smallcaps">The Text</span> was derived from Mr. Biot
Edmondston’s memory of a ballad sung to him by an old man in Unst,
Shetland. In the version sung, he notes, there were no stanzas to fill
the obvious gap in the story after the first; but that after the fourth
and the eighth stanzas, there had been certain verses which he had
forgotten. In the first instance, these related that the lady had been
carried off by fairies, and that the king, going in search of her, saw
her one day among a company that passed into a castle on the hillside.
After the eighth stanza, the ballad related that a messenger appeared
behind the grey stone, and invited the king&nbsp;in.</p>

<p>The refrain is a startling instance of phonetic tradition, the words
being repeated by rote long after the sense has been forgotten. It
appears that the two lines are Unst pronunciation of Danish, and that
they mean, respectively, ‘Early green’s the wood,’ and ‘Where the hart
goes yearly.’</p>

<p>In this connection, compare Arthur Edmondston’s <i>A&nbsp;View of the
Ancient and Present State of the Zetland Islands</i> (1809),
vol.&nbsp;i. p.&nbsp;142: ‘The island of Unst was its [pure Norse] last
abode; and not more than thirty years ago several individuals there
could speak it fluently.’ See also Rev. Dr. Barry’s <i>History of the
Orkney Islands</i> (1805), Appendix No.&nbsp;X., pp. 484-490,
a&nbsp;ballad of thirty-five quatrains in Norse as spoken in the
Orkneys, the subject of which is a contest between a King of Norway and
an Earl of Orkney, who had
<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<a name = "page209" id = "page209"> </a>
married the King’s daughter, in her father’s absence, and without his
consent.</p>


<p class = "space">
<span class = "smallcaps">The Story .</span>&mdash;Doubtless few will
recognise in this fragment an offshoot of the classical story of Orpheus
and Eurydice. The ballad, however, cannot be said to be derived directly
from the classical tale: rather it represents the <i>débris</i> of the
mediæval romance of <i>Orfeo and Heurodis</i>, where the kingdom of
Faëry (see 4.<sup>1</sup>) replaces Hades, and the tale is given a happy
ending by the recovery of Eurydice (for whom the Lady Isabel is here the
substitute). The romance exists as <i>Orfeo and Heurodis</i> in the
Auchinleck <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, of the fourteenth
century, in the Advocates’ Library, Edinburgh; as <i>Kyng Orfew</i> in
Ashmole <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 61, of the fifteenth

<span class = "smallcaps">The Story </span> of the ballad has a close
counterpart in Flemish Belgium, and in southern France. The German
variants, however, have a curious history. The English broadside ballad
was translated into German by F.&nbsp;W. Meyer in 1789, and in this form
gained such popularity that it was circulated not only as a broadside,
but actually in oral tradition,&mdash;with the usual result of
alteration. Its vogue was not confined to Germany, but spread to Hungary
and Scandinavia, a&nbsp;Swedish broadside appearing within ten years of
Meyer’s translation.</p>

other versions and various fragments. The tale is also found amongst the
Roxburghe Ballads, as <i>The Beautifull Shepherdesse of Arcadia</i>, in
two broadsides printed about 1655 and 1680. This is the only English
version extant. But earlier than any text of the ballad is a quotation
from it in John Fletcher’s <i>The Pilgrim</i>, iv.&nbsp;2 (1621). The
Scots versions, about a dozen in number, are far more lively than the
broadside. Buchan printed two, of sixty and sixty-three stanzas
respectively. Another text is delightfully inconsequent:&mdash;</p>

auld dochter, disguised as a shepherdess, is accosted by Sweet William,
brother to the Queen of Scotland, who gives his name as Wilfu’ Will,
varied by Jack and John. He attempts to escape, but she follows him to
court, and claims him in marriage from the king. He tries to avoid
discovery by pretending to be a cripple, but she knows him, refuses to
be bribed, marries him, and finally reveals herself to him.</p>

<p>The <i>dénouement</i> of the story is reminiscent of <i>The Marriage

‘At the Funeralls in Yorkeshire, to this day, they continue the custome
of watching &amp; sitting up all night till the body is inhersed. In the
interim some kneel down and pray (by the corps) some play at cards some
drink &amp; take Tobacco: they have also Mimicall playes &amp; sports,
e.g. they choose a simple young fellow to be a Judge, then the
suppliants (having first blacked their hands by rubbing it under the
bottom of the Pott) beseech his Lo:<sup>p</sup> [<i>i.e.</i> Lordship]
and smutt all his face. [‘They play likewise at Hott-cockles.’

‘This beliefe in Yorkshire was amongst the vulgar (&amp;&nbsp;phaps is

(1624) at the Funerall a woman came [like a Præfica] and sung this
following Song.’</p>

<p>Then follow several verses scratched out, and then the Dirge, to
which, however, is prefixed the remark,</p>

<p class = "verse">
‘This not ye first verse.’</p>

<p>As regards the doubtful reading ‘sleete’ for ‘fleet,’ there is
curiously contradictory evidence. Pennant, in his <i>Tour in
Scotland</i>, <span class = "smallroman">MDCCLXIX.</span> (Chester,
1771, pp. 91-92), remarks:&mdash;</p>

<p class = "inset">
‘On the death of a Highlander, the corps being stretched on a board, and
covered with a coarse linen wrapper, the friends lay on the breast of
the deceased a wooden platter, containing a small quantity of salt
<span class = "pagenum">240</span>
<a name = "page240" id = "page240"> </a>
and earth, separate and unmixed; the earth, an emblem of the corruptible
body; the salt, an emblem of the immortal spirit. All fire is
extinguished where a corps is kept; and it is reckoned so ominous, for a
dog or cat to pass over it, that the poor animal is killed without
mercy.</p>

<p class = "inset">
‘The <i>Late-wake</i> is a ceremony used at funerals: the evening after
the death of any person, the relations and friends of the deceased meet
at the house, attended by bagpipe or fiddle; the nearest of kin, be it
wife, son, or daughter, opens a melancholy ball, dancing and greeting;
<i>i.e.</i> crying violently at the same time; and this continues till
daylight; but with such gambols and frolicks, among the younger part of
the company, that the loss which occasioned them is often more than
supplied by the consequences of that night. If the corps remains
unburied for two nights the same rites are renewed.’</p>

<p>The Rev. J. C. Atkinson, on the other hand, states the contrary
regarding the fire,&mdash;see his <i>Glossary of the Cleveland
Dialect</i> (1868), p.&nbsp;595. He supposes ‘fleet’ to be equivalent to
the Cleveland ‘flet,’ live embers. ‘The usage, hardly extinct even yet
in the district, was on no account to suffer the fire in the house to go
out during the entire time the corpse lay in it, and throughout the same
time a candle was (or is yet) invariably kept burning in the same room
with the corpse.’</p>

<p>Bishop Kennett, in Lansdowne <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span>
1033, fol. 132, confirms Aubrey’s gloss of ‘fleet’ = water,
<span class = "pagenum">241</span>
<a name = "page241" id = "page241"> </a>
in quoting the first verse of the dirge. He adds, ‘hence the

The ‘Brig o’ Dread’ (which is perhaps a corruption of ‘the Bridge of the
Dead’), ‘Whinny-moor,’ and the Hell-shoon, have parallels in many
folklores. Thus, for the Brig, the Mohammedans have their
<i>Al-Sirat</i>, finer than a hair, sharper than a razor, stretched over
the midst of hell. The early Scandinavian mythology told of a bridge
over the river Giöll on the road to hell.</p>

<p>In Snorri’s <i>Edda</i>, when Hermôdhr went to seek the soul of
Baldr, he was told by the keeper of the bridge, a&nbsp;maiden named
Môdhgudhr, that the bridge rang beneath no feet save his. Similarly
Vergil tells us that Charon’s boat (which is also a parallel to the
Brig) was almost sunk by the weight of Æneas.</p>

<p>Whinny-moor is also found in Norse and German mythology. It has to be
traversed by all departed souls on their way to the realms of Hel or
Hela, the Goddess of Death. These realms were not only a place of
punishment: all who died went there, even the gods themselves taking
nine days and nights on the journey. The souls of Eskimo travel to
Torngarsuk, where
<span class = "pagenum">242</span>
<a name = "page242" id = "page242"> </a>
perpetual summer reigns; but the way thither is five days’ slide down a
precipice covered with the blood of those who have gone before.</p>

<p>The passage of Whinny-moor or its equivalent is facilitated by
Hell-shoon. These are obtained by the soul in various ways: the
charitable gift of a pair of shoes during life assures the right to use
them in crossing Whinny-moor; or a pair must be burned with the corpse,
or during the wake. In one of his Dialogues, Lucian makes the wife of
Eukrates return for the slipper which they had forgotten to burn.</p>

<p>Another parallel, though more remote, to the Hell-shoon, is afforded
by the account of one William Staunton, who, like so many others, was
privileged to see a vision of Purgatory and of the Earthly Paradise, on
the first Friday after the feast of the Exaltation of the Cross in the
year 1409. Accounts of such experiences, it may be remarked here, were
popular from the tenth century onwards amongst the Anglo-Saxons and
English, especially after the middle of the twelfth century, when the
story of the famous ‘St. Patrick’s Purgatory’ was first published.
William Staunton relates (Royal <span class = "smallroman">MS.</span> 17
B. xliii. in the British Museum) that in one part of Purgatory, as he
went along the side of a ‘water, the which was blak and fowle to sight,’
he saw
<span class = "pagenum">243</span>
<a name = "page243" id = "page243"> </a>
on the further side a tower, with a fair woman standing thereon, and a
ladder against the tower: but ‘hit was so litille, as me thowght that it
wold onnethe [scarcely] bere ony thing; and the first rong of the ladder
was so that onnethe might my fynger reche therto, and that rong was
sharper than ony rasor.’ Hearing a ‘grisly noyse’ coming towards him,
William ‘markid’ himself with a prayer, and the noise vanished, and he
saw a rope let down over the ladder from the top of the tower. And when
the woman had drawn him safely to the top, she told him that the cord
was one that he had once given to a chapman who had been robbed.</p>

<p>The whole subject of St. Patrick’s Purgatory is extremely
interesting; but it is outside our present scope, and can best be
studied in connection with the mythology of the <i>Lyke-wake Dirge</i>
in Thomas Wright’s <i>St. Patrick’s Purgatory</i> (1844). The popularity
of the story is attested by accounts extant in some thirty-five Latin
and English <span class = "smallroman">MSS.</span> in the British
Museum, in the Bodleian, at Cambridge, and at Edinburgh. Calderon wrote
a drama round the myth, <i>El Purgatorio de San Patricio</i>; Robert
Southey a ballad; and an early poem of George Wither’s, lost in <span
class = "smallroman">MS.</span>, treated of the same subject. Recently
the tale has received attention in G.&nbsp;P. Krapp’s
<span class = "pagenum">244</span>
<a name = "page244" id = "page244"> </a>
<i>Legend of St. Patrick’s Purgatory</i>, Baltimore, 1900.</p>

<p>A correspondent in <i>Notes and Queries</i>, 9th Ser., xii. 475
(December 12, 1903), remarks that the ‘liche-wake’ is still spoken of in
the Peak district of Derbyshire.</p>
